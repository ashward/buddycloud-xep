  <p>Upon connection to the buddycloud server a user should send a register 
     stanza.</p>

  <example caption="The Entity sends a register request to the domain">
  <![CDATA[
  <iq type='set'
  from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
  to='channels.capulet.lit'
  id='register1'>
  <query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'/>
  </iq>
  ]]>
  </example>

  <p>The register request creates the user's personal channels on first use 
  and has the additional benefit of creating additional new channel nodes 
  as they become available on the server (e.g. 'status' node, 'geoloc' nodes).
