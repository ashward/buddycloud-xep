<section1 topic='Channel Introduction' anchor='intro'>
	<p>Channels are a bundle of pub-sub nodes that have the same owner,
		folllowers and access permissions. There are two types of channel:
		user channels (named after the user's JID), for example
		romeo@montagu.lit) and topic channels, for example
		balcony-speeches@topics.montague.lit) which are owned by the channel
		creator. Content posted into channels is automatically synchronised to
		the correct followers on other Buddycloud servers.
