			<p>A Channel Server MUST maintain similar affiliations for a
				subscribed entity across all the Nodes of a Channel.
			</p>
			<p>To achieve this a Client MUST only update the affiliation of the
				/posts Channel Node. The Channel Server MUST then maintain the
				affiliation of the other Channel Nodes appropriately according to
				the following table:
			</p>
			<table caption="Node Affiliation Mappings">
				<tr>
					<th>Affiliation set for the /posts Channel Node</th>
					<th>Affiliation implied for the other Channel Nodes</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>owner</td>
					<td>owner</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>moderator</td>
					<td>follower</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>follower+post</td>
					<td>follower</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>follower</td>
					<td>follower</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>none</td>
					<td>none</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>outcast</td>

			<p>Note that this only applies to Personal Channels as Topic Channels
