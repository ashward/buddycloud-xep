<section1 topic='Buddycloud Introduction' anchor='intro'>
	<p>Buddycloud is a set of servers and clients that enable rich
		federated communication between uses and groups. Buddycloud builds on
		XMPP's native federaton and pubsub principles to connect to and
		synchronise updates with other Buddycloud servers.
	</p>
	<p>At buddycloud's core are "channels". Channels represent a bundle of
		publish-subscribe nodes that have the same owner, folllowers and
		permissions. There are two types of channel: a user channel, for
		example channel:romeo@montagu.lit) and a topic channel,
		(beer@montague.liu)
