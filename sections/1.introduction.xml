		<p>Buddycloud channels is a decentralised communication protocol that
			enables synchronised communication in the form of channels between
			Buddycloud-enabled domains.
		</p>
		<p>Buddycloud channels build on XMPP's native federation and
			asynchronous messaging to provide a decentralised sharing and
			communication network. The Buddycloud ecosystem contains multiple
			[XMPP] components (for example: location-butler, media-server and
			channel-directory) that work together and enable developers to build
			new communication products.
